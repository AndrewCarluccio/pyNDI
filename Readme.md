# PyNDI

A Very simple video reader for NDI using CFFI (must be added as a dependency) created by [CarlosFdez](https://github.com/CarlosFdez).
Very initial state, only reads video, use at your own risk.

Tested with NDI 4.5.

The NDI runtime must be installed. Recommended NDI tools to be installed too for testing.
